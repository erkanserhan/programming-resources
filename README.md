# Overview

Most of the resources I'll use for this class will be stored in this repository. Each lesson we go through will have a folder here.

I will attach example programs or other code snippets in their lesson's folder, as well as a text file (much like this one) with a general lesson overview and the concepts I'll be teaching.
I won't teach directly off of these plans, but most important information will be written down, so feel free to look back at these for review.

Additionally, there is a Resources folder where I'll put quick references to information such as code syntax, or handy tips. I'll update this as we learn more.
